## Getting Started

Hi, my name is Duvan Vasquez, and this is my technical test for MoonHi. In this project, I implemented an API for basic calculation operations with a Node.js backend.

Additionally, I added a frontend part using Next.js and Shadcn for styling the project.

Thank you, and have a good day!


## Run project 

First, run the backend file in your console with the command npm start. This command starts the server at http://localhost:3001/api/calculate.

Second, run the frontend file in your console with the command yarn start. This command starts the server at http://localhost:3000.

And you're done! Execute the technical test!
